# PyTorch Fundamentals Practice

This repository contains my personal practice space for mastering PyTorch fundamentals. It covers essential PyTorch concepts, including tensors, autograd, neural networks, and more.

## Contents

- **Linear Regression**: Implementations of linear regression using PyTorch
- **Non-linear Datasets**: Examples working with non-linearly separable datasets
- **Computer Vision Neural Networks**: Projects involving image classification and processing
- **Miscellaneous**: Additional experiments and explorations

## Setup

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages (`pip install torch`)
3. Run Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts

## Contributing

Feel free to fork and contribute! I welcome improvements, bug fixes, and new implementations.
